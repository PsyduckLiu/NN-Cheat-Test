# NN-Cheat-Test
- [ ] Load a model (both a random model and a trained model).
- [ ] For each hidden layer, first identify critical points. Then, calculate the ratio of noise critical points by using the cheated real NN. Next, compute the output of the last layer and calculate the ratio of zero-neurons in this layer, again using the cheated real NN.
- [ ] Repeat step 2 and analyze which reason contributes the most to the failure of weight recovery, particularly in the deeper layers.
